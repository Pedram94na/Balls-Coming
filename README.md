# Balls-Coming
A 2D game where the player has to avoid the balls for as long as they can and collect coins. There are also 3 different types of power-ups.
As the player progresses through the game, the speed of the balls, coins, and power-ups increase.

The balls and the collectables (coins and power-ups) are implemented by inheritance.

The highes coins of each player is submitted to the database and can be seen on the leaderboards.
For the database, I used LootLocker. The player can change their name on the main menu.
